# Airquality Dataset

Airquality data set is available in R using the following command:

```{r load_airquality}
data(airquality)
```

Resulting in a dataset with the same name: 

```{r head_airquality}
head(airquality, 4)
```

# Dataset description

The air quality data contains the following columns: 
```
- Ozone: Mean ozone in parts per billion.  
- Solar.R: Solar radiation in Langleys.  
- Wind: Average wind speed in mph.  
- Temp: Maximum daily temperature in Fº.  
- Month: Month of sample.
- Day: Day of sample.
```
We want to **predict Ozone levels** in terms of other columns, that is: 

$$Ozone \sim Solar.R + Wind + Temp + Month + Day$$

# Prediction model

We have used the `caret` package to train the prediction model: 

```{r cleanning_up, echo=FALSE}
airquality <- airquality[!is.na(airquality$Ozone),];
airquality <- airquality[!is.na(airquality$Solar.R),];
```

```{r training, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(caret)
model <- train(Ozone ~ ., 
               data = airquality, 
               method="lm");
```

But using R is too complicated for some users.

We have created a Shiny Application to interact with the prediction model easily through a friendly user interface.
